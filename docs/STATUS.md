# Status

Where the project stands, what's been checked, what hasn't, and what comes next. Written 10 October 2026, when work moved from the first PC to a personal one. Update it as things change; the detail of how each part was built is in [MILESTONES.md](MILESTONES.md).

## In one line

Version 0.1.0 is released on GitHub (10 October 2026) and works on the PC it was made on: reading aloud, the Read button, Compose, the AI helpers on the PC and on Claude, the word tools, settings, the installer and an opt-in update check. Some parts haven't been tried by a user yet.

## Built

| Milestone | What | State |
|---|---|---|
| 0 to 2 | Solution, voice spike, text pipeline | Done |
| 3 | Player, reading view, tray, toasts, vibes | Done, used daily |
| 4 | Selection capture and Ctrl+Alt+Space | Done, checked in Teams, VS Code, Chrome and Outlook |
| 5 | Read button and styled quick menu | Done |
| 6 | Tabbed Settings, pronunciations, readable text, Start with Windows | Done |
| 7 | Packaging: installer, release workflow, welcome screen | Done. v0.1.0 released; the released installer was downloaded, checked against its published checksum, installed silently over an existing copy, registered with Windows, and started |
| 8 | Compose: spelling, Read back, Send to chat, drafts, Edit and Put it back, Paste on the Read button | Done |
| 9 | AI helpers: Check my thinking, Tidy, Make a request; on this PC (Qwen3 4B) and Claude | Done for those three actions |
| 10 | Claude provider, key storage, cost shown, first-use confirmation | Built early, as part of 9 |
| Extras | Word tools, Privacy and licences page, opt-in update check, code scanning, Dependabot, a how-to guide with pictures ([GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md)) | Done |

267 Core tests and 3 Windows tests pass, on both PCs. Every push builds and is scanned on GitHub.

## Tried by the maintainer

- Voices, play, pause, stop, replay, speed, volume, output device.
- The shortcut in Teams, VS Code, Chrome and Outlook.
- Watch clipboard's offer to read.
- Messages on the main monitor with three monitors at different scaling.
- Compose's look, spelling underlines and the right-click menu, after the fixes.
- The welcome screen and the Settings pages, after the fixes for text running off the edge.
- A second PC: v0.1.0 installed and ran; the development copy builds, passes every test, and runs from the build folder.

## Not tried yet

- **Send to chat** and **Put it back** into a real chat box, and that the clipboard is unchanged afterwards.
- **Edit** and **Paste** on the Read button.
- **Use this window**, and Ctrl+Alt+C picking up the right window.
- **Check my thinking** and **Tidy** on real writing, in daily use.
- **Claude** in the cloud. No key has been entered yet.
- **Word tools** in daily use.
- **The update check** against a real release. The quiet install and restart were tried with two local installers on the second PC; the check and the download need 0.1.1 installed and a newer release published.
- **Start with Windows** after a real sign-in, from the installed location.
- From the acceptance list: Word, PDFs in a browser and Acrobat, Notepad, Explorer renaming, Windows Terminal, the Claude desktop app.

## Known issues and limits

- The local AI takes 10 to 20 seconds per action and uses about 4.7 GB of memory with the voice while loaded. It unloads after 10 idle minutes.
- The local model sometimes mis-quotes a word in its notes, and once changed "Ok" to "Okay" despite being told to keep informal words.
- Output device names are cut at 31 characters.
- Syllables come from hyphenation patterns, so a few split oddly ("in·form·a·tion").
- The app isn't code-signed, so Windows SmartScreen warns on first run.
- In 0.1.0, Update now can't start the installer, so it closes the app without updating. Fixed in 0.1.1.
- The v0.1.0 installer offers to install for all users. A copy installed that way never offers Update now. Fixed for the next release, which installs per-user only.
- Code scanning lists 49 style notes, mostly broad catches and LINQ suggestions: a tidy-up list, not bugs.
- On a PC with Smart App Control on, Windows may block the unsigned app outright rather than warn. Code signing would help. On the second PC it blocked development builds until it was turned off ([DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md)).
- The local AI is refused on processors without AVX2, though the library ships a fallback build that might work on older ones. Worth testing before relaxing the check.
- FlaUI brings in about 25 MB of Windows Forms. Calling UI Automation directly would remove it.
- Kokoro has no text normaliser. Numbers, dates and money are handled by rules in `NumberSpeech`; each new oddity heard becomes a rule with a test.

## Not built yet

- **Summarise** and **Explain simply**: the instructions are written and editable in Settings, but there are no buttons. The brief puts them in the player and Compose, with a small result card beside the player.
- The brief's three-way **AI result card** overlay for the player.
- A **microphone choice**. Dictation uses Windows' own voice typing (Win+H), which already works in Compose.
- **macOS** (milestone 11).

## Next, in order

1. **Release 0.1.1.** The version is set and the notes are written; the tag is Dave's call. Copies of 0.1.0 can't update themselves, so they need 0.1.1 installed by hand. Try the update check for real when the next version comes.
2. **On GitHub:** add topics. Private vulnerability reporting, Dependabot alerts and secret scanning with push protection are on.
3. **Try everything under "Not tried yet"**, fix what turns up, and log it.
4. **Code signing.** Unsigned for now, with build attestations instead. Apply to SignPath once Helpers has visible use ([CODE-SIGNING.md](CODE-SIGNING.md)).
5. **Summarise and Explain simply** buttons, and the player's result card.
6. **A browser extension** for Chrome and Edge, to put Read and Edit on the right-click menu.
7. **A product name.** "Helpers" is a working title.
8. **macOS.**

## Decisions still open

- The product name.
- How to promote it.

Decided 11 October 2026: ship unsigned for now, with a build attestation on every release file from 0.1.1, and come back to SignPath once Helpers has visible use.
